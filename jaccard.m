function p = jaccard_similarity(A,B)
%% jaccard similarity
% This function calculates jaccard similarity index of inputs arrays A and
% B. The formula to find the Index is (number of entries in both sets) / (number of entries in either set) * 100
% The higher the percentage, the more similar the two arrays. 
% For this, each of input arrays is modified by removing its same entries
% (except on them), then number of common entries between two new arrays is
% calculated by comparing them.
